#  Smart Campus Vehicle Monitoring System 
#  Project Overview

The Smart Campus Vehicle Monitoring System is a Deep Learning and YOLO-based computer vision application developed to detect, classify, track, and count vehicles such as cars and college buses within a campus environment. The system is capable of processing single images, multiple images, CCTV footage, and uploaded videos in real time using advanced object detection and tracking techniques.

This project combines Transfer Learning using MobileNetV2 and real-time object detection using YOLOv8 to create an intelligent vehicle monitoring platform. The application is deployed through Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly web interface for vehicle detection and monitoring.

# Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to build a smart vehicle monitoring system that can:

Detect vehicles from images and videos
Classify vehicles as cars or college buses
Count total vehicles automatically
Monitor CCTV footage in real time
Track vehicles without duplicate counting
Provide live visualization using Streamlit

#  Technologies Used

The project is developed using the following technologies and frameworks:

Python
TensorFlow
MobileNetV2
YOLOv8
OpenCV
Streamlit
NumPy
Pillow
Ultralytics YOLO Framework

# Deep Learning Model

The project uses MobileNetV2, a pretrained convolutional neural network trained on the ImageNet dataset. Transfer Learning is used to improve accuracy while reducing training time and computational requirements.

The model architecture includes:

Data Augmentation Layer
MobileNetV2 Feature Extractor
GlobalAveragePooling2D Layer
Dense Layer with ReLU Activation
Dropout Layer
Sigmoid Output Layer

The sigmoid activation function is used for binary classification between:

Car
College Bus

#  YOLOv8 Object Detection

YOLOv8 is used for real-time object detection and vehicle tracking. The model detects multiple vehicles simultaneously and generates bounding boxes around detected objects.

The YOLO module in this project supports:

Real-time object detection
Vehicle counting
CCTV monitoring
Video processing
Object tracking
Duplicate count prevention

The project uses the pretrained YOLOv8 Nano model (yolov8n.pt) for faster inference and real-time performance.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains two vehicle categories:

Cars
College Buses

The dataset is manually separated into:

Training Dataset
Testing Dataset

Folder structure:

# Features
🔹 Single Image Detection

The system allows users to upload a single image and perform vehicle detection. The application detects cars and buses, draws bounding boxes, and displays the vehicle count.

🔹 Batch Image Detection

Users can upload multiple images simultaneously. The system processes all uploaded images and generates cumulative vehicle counts.

🔹 CCTV / Video Detection

The project supports CCTV footage and uploaded videos. YOLOv8 tracking is used to monitor moving vehicles in real time while avoiding duplicate counting using unique track IDs.
